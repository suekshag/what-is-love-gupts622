      <h2 class="subhead wow fadeInUp">TANABATA – THE STORY OF ORIHIME & HIKOBOSHI</h2> 
    
    <p class=" para wow fadeInUp">Sacramento, CA – Sensory Friendly Dance, now in its seventh year of producing inclusive and engaging dance events in Sacramento, will present the premiere of Tanabata: The Story of Orihime and Hikoboshi, based on the Japanese tale celebrating the annual Star Festival.
<br>
<br>
Choreographed by Sacramento Ballet dancer Kaori Higashiyama, in collaboration with local artist Emi Mizuno, Tanabata: The Story of Orihime and Hikoboshi will make its world premiere on Saturday, June 24, 2023 at 1:00pm at B Street Theater. The performance will also be live streamed so audiences near and far can tune in for the premiere.
<br>
<br>
This centuries-old tale tells the story of star-crossed lovers Princess Orihime and cow-herder Hikoboshi. They are represented as the stars Altair and Vega respectively. Princess Orihime is a wonderful seamstress who gathers pieces of cloth from the sky river, the Milky Way, to make beautiful clothes for her community. Orihime’s father introduces her to the cow-herder Hikoboshi who lives on the other side of the Milky Way, and Orihime and Hikoboshi fall instantly in love. In their deep love for one another however, Orihime stops sewing and Hikoboshi neglects his responsibility to tend the cows wandering the sky. Orihime’s father becomes angry and separates the two lovers by the Milky Way forbidding them to meet except once a year on the 7th day of the 7th month (July 7th). Only on this day, if the skies are clear, Orihime and Hikoboshi can meet again in the sky to rekindle their love.
<br>
<br>
In Japan, this story is celebrated with Tanabata, the Star Festival, where people gather to wish for clear skies, star gaze, and to write their personal wishes on pieces of colorful paper called tankazu that are then hung on bamboo wishing trees. At the live performance, audience members will have an opportunity to participate in Tanabata by contributing their own wishes to colorful wishing trees set up in the lobby. Additionally, Sensory Friendly Dance will release a film of the performance on their website on Tanabata, July 7th, so audiences all over the world can learn about and celebrate Tanabata with their own community.
<br>
<br>
Sensory Friendly Dance provides the neurodiverse community opportunities to engage with fellow Sacramentans through dance. By making adjustments to the theater environment such as leaving the lights on and lowering the music volume, by relaxing traditional theater rules such as allowing audiences to play with fidget toys and talk during the performance, a climate of acceptance and understanding is cultivated, helping everyone feel welcome at a live dance performance.
