    <p class=" para wow fadeInUp">Wrote George, the Duke of York, to Mary in England regarding the wedding of the Russian Tsarevich Nicholas II and Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt.
        <br>
        <br>

Some of the greatest love stories exist in history books, and the romance of Nicholas and Alexandra is quite the page turner, set against the tumultuous backdrop of the Russian Revolution.
  <br>
        <br>

They first met at the ages of 12 and 16, when Alixâ€™s sister, Ella, married Grand Duke Serge, the younger brother of Tsar Alexander III.Â The two could not help but exchange glances.They did not see each other again until five years later, when Alix spent six weeks in St. Petersburg and they began spending more time together.

        <br>
After their wedding she wrote,
  <br>
        <br>
â€œNever did I believe there could be such utter happiness in this world, such a feeling of unity between two mortal beings. I love you, these three words have my life in them.â€
