    <h1 class="heading wow fadeInUp">LOVE STORY OF INDIA</h1>
      <h2 class="subhead wow fadeInUp">THE TALE OF RADHA AND KRISHNA</h2>
    
    <p class=" para wow fadeInUp">From mythological to this technological era, Radha Krishna has always been symbolised as a benchmark of love. These two words in our Indian history are never been taken separately. Whenever we talk about Radha, it is impossible for any human being to not to think about Lord Krishna. It definitely strikes our head and compels us to think at least once about the everlasting tale of love.
<br>
<br>
They shared an eternal love with each other. Regardless of the fact that they never tied a nuptial knot together, they are worshipped together. These days, modern-day couples admire these pure souls most and make promises to each other to be like them. They are the representation of the purest bond, love, and emotions. It is their purity and serenity only which has made their love and care unforgettable.
<br>
<br>
There are several life lessons which young couples can learn from their story and implement it in their life to make their bond of love stronger and better. From the mythological days of the universe, Radha is known to be an avatar of Goddess Shakti and the most dedicated devotee of Lord Krishna. Lord Krishnaâ€™s flute was enough to mesmerise her because she was madly in love with him.

<h2 class="subhead wow fadeInUp">The Beauty of Radha-Krishna</h2>
<p class=" para wow fadeInUp">
Radha Krishna together has not only taught us to love each other but also taught that with love it is necessary to have patience, power of sacrifice, and strength to support your love. It is you that can bring your love in front of the society. It is not easy to always keep that same spirit of love for anyone. But the great devotee Radha has proved whatever the situation comes in the life; if you have a pure love spirit no one can demolish it. You are the one who creates that feeling and you are the ones who can preserve it. Difficulties and problems are part of your life as happiness is a part of your life.
