    <p class=" para wow fadeInUp">=Las arras matrimoniales are 13 coins often gifted from los padrinos y madrinas, or wedding godparents. After the blessing and exchange of rings, the priest blesses these 13 coins and the groom presents it to the bride as a symbol of his commitment to care for her and their home.

        Historically, the wedding coins were provided as a dowry, back when marriages were arranged between families of the bride and groom. Today the ceremony is more symbolic than practical. The blessing and presentation of the wedding coins are incorporated into the marriage service as another unity ceremony that signifies the shared responsibility of managing household finances, and the sacrifices that might entail.

        “Traditionally, the coins served as a dowry, as weddings were usually pre-arranged,” says Claudia G. de Velasco, a wedding planner based in Houston. “In today’s modern world, the symbolism of the wedding coins represents a promise of prosperity in the couple’s marriage, as well as a promise to always protect each other’s wealth.”

        Historians can't pin down exactly when this tradition began, but we know it originated in Spain and spread to other countries as Spaniards conquered foreign lands. The word arras in Spanish means "earnest money,” and the coins represent the groom’s promise to provide for the family. The bride’s acceptance of the coins symbolizes her trust in her soon-to-be husband to do so. “Traditionally, there are 13 coins, 12 gold and one platinum, all the same size,” de Velasco explains. “Each gold coin represents the wealth shared between the couple for each month of the year, with the platinum coin designed to share with the less fortunate.”

The 13 coins carry multiple meanings; 12 of the coins represent Jesus’ 12 apostles and the importance of putting God first in their marriage. The 12 coins also represent the 12 months of the year and prosperity for the newlyweds as they combine finances. The last coin symbolizes overabundance and reminds the couple that they should always try to give back to the less fortunate if they're blessed with more than they need. 

The 13 coins are housed in an ornate gold box, chest, or velvet drawstring bag. The box is presented as a gift from the groom to his bride as a symbol of commitment and trust. Two become one in marriage, and this ritual serves as a symbol of the groom sharing his wealth with his bride. With this gesture, the groom is putting his trust in her to keep their money safe and maintain their household.
