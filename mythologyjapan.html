  The cherry blossom, according to the language of flowers, symbolizes innocence, purity and beauty. They grow very slowly, burst into life for a brief period and then are just as quickly snatched away by wind, rain and the changes of the season. In Japanese belief, sakura represents the transience of life. You are born and live for a brief moment, then fade away. It’s a bittersweet way of viewing things and one that has a large part in shaping Japanese culture historically.

Put this in a relationship perspective. Spring is the start of the new year for schools, new workers joining companies, moving to new homes, marriage proposals… and of course, changing schools, moving away from home and many other, less positive changes. As the season of change, spring is historically a time when new relationships start (and old ones end).
<br>
<br>
For those starting at university, it’s a great time to meet new people, join clubs and activities, head out and see the city as an adult. Many people in Japan start having their first serious relationships at this time.

The same applies to work. New graduates start work in April and since the Japanese work environment will have them spend the majority of their lives at the workplace, it is common to meet their significant other there.
<br>
<br>
Or maybe you’re already dating someone and they’ve been transferred to a new department at work; Another common occurrence in spring in Japan. This will often result in him (or you) having to adjust to new tasks and responsibilities. Maybe even new, sometimes longer, overtime hours to stay on track with work. While this comes with the territory of any new job, there have been more than a few instances where either the man or woman has used this new schedule to “politely” end a relationship. So ladies, if you are unsatisfied with your partner and are looking for a change, maybe taking the Japanese approach is best for you.

Couples that have been together longer may be faced with a different prospect come spring: job transfers. My friend had this happen to her a few years ago. Her husband came home from work around the start of April, sat her down on the sofa and told her that he was being transferred to Johannesburg at the end of the month—alone. His company wasn’t willing to pay for his wife to come too despite it being a two to five-year transfer. It almost ended their marriage. Communicate with your partner if this sort of situation comes up. It can either become the start of a new adventure together or the start of one alone.

<br>
Spring is the season of new life, change, beauty and innocence. It’s a time when the dregs of winter have been finally cleared away and everyone feels refreshed. Make the most of it and let me know what your plans are in the comments below! If you want to find me, just head to Yoyogi Park, I practically live there during hanami season.
